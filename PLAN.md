# WorkPlan — Personal Context Engine

## Problem Statement

Managing hundreds of daily interactions across dozens of projects leads to lost context — forgetting what was discussed, what's owed, and what to prepare for. This tool serves as a personal CRM and context engine to solve: "Before I talk to someone or walk into a meeting, what do I need to know?"

| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Framework        | Next.js (App Router)          | Server components, server actions, file-based routing        |
| Database         | SQLite (v1) → PostgreSQL      | Prisma ORM — migration is a provider swap + minor type fixes |
| Auth             | Deferred (backlog)            | Not needed while running locally; add Auth.js + magic links when deploying remotely |
| UI               | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS      | Copy-paste components, no library lock-in                    |
| API Style        | REST                          | Route handlers in `app/api/`                                 |
| State Management | React state + server components | No extra library                                           |
| Keyword Search   | SQLite FTS5                   | Full-text keyword search across all notes/interactions       |
| Vector Search    | sqlite-vec + better-sqlite3   | Semantic similarity search; managed outside Prisma via raw SQL |
| Embeddings       | @xenova/transformers          | Local embeddings via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim, ~40MB, no API calls) |
| Hosting          | Local (v1)                    | Architecture should not preclude Vercel deployment           |

## Data Model

### Core Entities

```
Project
  - id, name, description, status, metadata (JSON), created_at, updated_at

Person
  - id, name, email, role/title, organization, notes, metadata (JSON), created_at, updated_at

Interaction
  - id, type (meeting | chat | in-person | other)
  - subject, date/time
  - raw_content (original pasted text — preserved for future AI processing)
  - parsed_content (structured/cleaned version)
  - metadata (JSON — flexible field for future AI-extracted data)
  - project_id (optional FK)
  - created_at, updated_at

ActionItem
  - id, description, status (open | in-progress | done | cancelled)
  - due_date (optional)
  - priority (optional)
  - interaction_id (FK — where it originated)
  - project_id (optional FK)
  - metadata (JSON)
  - created_at, updated_at

InteractionPerson (join table)
  - interaction_id, person_id

ActionItemPerson (join table)
  - action_item_id, person_id
```

### AI-Readiness Decisions (no extra work now, saves pain later)

- **`raw_content`** on interactions: preserves original text so AI can re-process as models improve
- **`metadata` (JSON)** on all core entities: avoids
- schema migrations when adding AI-extracted fields (tags, sentiment, entities, summaries)
- **Clean service layer**: note creation and processing logic in dedicated server actions / API route handlers, not scattered in components — easy to insert AI processing step later
- **Dual search from day 1**: SQLite FTS5 for keyword search + sqlite-vec for semantic similarity search. AI-generated summaries/tags automatically become searchable when added
- **Local embeddings**: `@xenova/transformers` with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` generates 384-dim embeddings locally — no API calls, no cost, full data privacy. Embeddings are generated on interaction save and stored in a separate vector table managed via `better-sqlite3` (Prisma doesn't support vector extensions natively)
- **PostgreSQL vector migration path**: swap sqlite-vec for pgvector, update `lib/embedding-search.ts` only — components and server actions untouched

## v1 Core Features

### 1. Daily Dashboard
- Today's meetings with participants and project context
- Overdue and upcoming action items
- Quick-add interaction / action item

### 2. Person View
- Contact details
- Interaction history (last N conversations)
- Open action items involving this person
- Projects in common
- "What do I need to know about this person right now?"

### 3. Meeting Prep View
- Given a meeting (or upcoming interaction), show:
  - All participants and recent interaction history with each
  - Open action items related to those people and/or the project
  - Previous meetings with the same group
- Quick link from dashboard for today's meetings

### 4. Project View
- All people involved
- All interactions tagged to this project
- Open action items for the project
- Notes and decisions timeline

### 5. Interaction Capture
- Paste raw meeting notes → stored as `raw_content`
- Paste Outlook meeting invite → parse subject, date/time, attendees (text parsing, no API)
- Link to people and project
- Add action items inline during note entry

### 6. Action Items
- First-class entities with status, optional due date, linked to interaction + people + project
- List view with filters: by person, project, status, due date
- Mark complete/cancel from any view

### 7. Search (Keyword + Semantic)
- **Keyword search**: FTS5 index — exact/stemmed word matching across all interactions, notes, action items
- **Semantic search**: sqlite-vec — "find related context" even when wording differs (e.g., searching "budget" also surfaces notes about "financial review")
- Embeddings generated automatically on interaction/note save via `@xenova/transformers` (local, no API)
- Unified search UI with results from both engines, linked back to source interaction/person/project

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Scaffold
- Initialize Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint
- Install and configure shadcn/ui
- Set up Prisma with SQLite
- Set up better-sqlite3 + sqlite-vec for vector tables
- Set up @xenova/transformers for local embeddings
- Define schema (all entities above)
- Create app layout with navigation

### Phase 2: Core CRUD
- People: create, list, view, edit
- Projects: create, list, view, edit
- Interactions: create (with paste support), list, view, edit
- Action items: create, list, view, edit, status transitions
- Link entities (interactions ↔ people, action items ↔ people/projects)

### Phase 3: Key Views
- Daily dashboard
- Person view (aggregated context)
- Meeting prep view
- Project view (aggregated context)

### Phase 4: Search & Polish
- SQLite FTS5 keyword search
- sqlite-vec semantic search + auto-embedding on save
- Unified search UI (keyword + semantic results)
- Outlook invite parsing
- UI polish, loading states, empty states

## Backlog (Future)

- **AI-assisted processing**: Paste notes → auto-extract action items, tag people/projects, generate summaries (Claude API)
- **Calendar integration**: Direct sync with Outlook/Google Calendar
- **Teams integration**: Pull chat/meeting context directly
- **Notifications**: Email reminders for upcoming meetings and overdue action items
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (NextAuth v5) with magic links via Resend — add when deploying remotely
- **Vercel deployment**: Move from local to cloud hosting
- **PostgreSQL migration**: Switch Prisma provider when ready to scale
- **Offline support / PWA**
- **Recurring meetings**: Track series and surface context across occurrences
